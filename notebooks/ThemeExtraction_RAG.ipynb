      "1. Sea-level rise: As global temperatures rise, the oceans are expanding, causing sea levels to rise. This can lead to flooding, erosion, and saltwater intrusion into freshwater sources.\n",
      "2. Increased storm intensity: Climate change is projected to increase the frequency and intensity of storms, which can cause catastrophic damage to coastal cities and infrastructure.\n",
      "3. Coastal erosion: Rising sea levels and increased storm activity can lead to coastal erosion, causing beaches to disappear and coastal defenses to be breached.\n",
      "4. Saltwater intrusion: As sea levels rise, saltwater can intrude into freshwater sources, making them undrinkable and affecting agriculture and industry.\n",
      "5. Loss of infrastructure: Climate change can cause flooding and damage to coastal infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and buildings.\n",
      "6. Displacement of communities: Rising sea levels and increased storm activity can lead to the displacement of communities living in low-lying areas, as their homes and livelihoods become uninhabitable.\n",
      "7. Increased risk of waterborne diseases: Climate change can contaminate water sources with sewage, chemicals, and other pollutants, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.\n",
      "8. Loss of biodiversity: Coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change, leading to the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem disruption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some specific examples of coastal cities affected by climate change include:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Miami Beach, Florida, USA: Rising sea levels have caused frequent flooding and erosion, threatening the city's very existence.\n",
      "* Venice, Italy: The city is sinking at a rate of 1-2 mm per year due to subsidence and rising sea levels, making it increasingly vulnerable to flooding.\n",
      "* Jakarta, Indonesia: The city is experiencing frequent flooding and saltwater intrusion, threatening the livelihoods of millions of people.\n",
      "* Bangkok, Thailand: Rising sea levels and increased storm activity have caused significant damage to the city's infrastructure and posed a threat to its very existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate these impacts, coastal cities are implementing various adaptation strategies, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Sea walls and coastal defenses\n",
      "2. Flood-control measures, such as levees and pumps\n",
      "3. Green infrastructure, such as parks and green roofs\n",
      "4. Climate-resilient construction materials and designs\n",
      "5. Early warning systems for extreme weather events\n",
      "6. Urban planning and zoning regulations to reduce the risk of flooding and erosion.\n",

Energy efficiency and sustainable development: The documents emphasize the importance of integrating adaptation planning with sustainable development, including energy efficiency measures.\\n2. Climate change vulnerability and risk assessment: The documents highlight the need for assessing vulnerability and risk associated with climate change, which is essential for developing effective adaptation strategies.\\n3. Capacity building and institutional strengthening: The documents stress the importance of capacity building and institutional strengthening to support adaptation efforts, particularly in developing countries.\\n4. Integration of climate change into national policies: The documents encourage Parties to integrate climate change considerations into their national policies, including energy policy, agriculture, water management, and other sectors.\\n5. Research and development of new technologies: The documents promote research on adaptation options and the development and diffusion of new technologies, know-how, and practices for adaptation.\\n\\nHowever, I couldn't find specific information on energy policy, climate adaptation, and mitigation strategies that are directly related to each other.

Identification of key adaptation needs\\n13.  Based on this overview and framework, past and current practices for adaptation to\\nclimate change and climate variability will be identified as related to existing information\\nregarding the country’s vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change, climate variability\\nand extreme weather events, as well as long-term climate change.  This section will explain how\\nand to what extent activities may address specific vulnerabilities.\\n14.  Given the actual and potential adverse effects of climate change described in section F.2\\nabove, this section will identify relevant adaptation options including capacity building, policy\\nreform, integration into sectoral policies and project-level activities.\\n4.  Criteria for selecting priority activities\\n15.  A set of locally-driven criteria will be used to select priority adaptation activities.  These\\ncriteria should include, inter alia :\\n(a)  Level or degree of adverse effects of climate change;\\n(b)  Poverty reduction to enhance adaptive capacity;\\n(c)  Synergy with other multilateral environmental agreements;\\n(d)  Cost-effectiveness.\\n16.  These criteria for prioritization will be applied to , inter alia :\\n(a)  Loss of life and livelihood;\\n(b)  Human health;\\n(c)  Food security and agriculture;\\n(d)  Water availability, quality and accessibility;\\n(e)  Essential infrastructure;\\n(f)  Cultural heritage;\\n(g)  Biological diversity;\\n(h)  Land-use management and forestry;\\n(i)  Other environmental amenities;\\n(j)  Coastal zones, and associated loss of land.'),\n",

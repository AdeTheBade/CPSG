34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

64. Affirms that the framework for the global go al on adaptation includes the following 
targets in relation to the dimensions of the iterative adaptation cycle, recognizing the need to 
enhance adaptation action and support: 
(a) Impact, vulnerability and risk assessment: by 2030 all Parties have conducted 
up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and 
vulnerabilities and have used the outcomes of these assessments to inform their formulation 
of national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes a nd/or strategies, 
and by 2027 all Parties have established multi -hazard early warning systems, climate 
information services for risk reduction and systematic observation to support improved 
climate-related data, information and services; 
(b) Planning: by 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, gender-responsive, 
participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and 
planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people 
and vulnerable communities, and have mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and 
plans; 
(c) Implementation: by 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their 
national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and 
economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in 
paragraph 64(a) above; 
(d) Monitoring, evaluation and learning: by 2030 all Parties have designed, 
established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their 
national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully 
implement the system; 
65. Also affirms that efforts in relation to the targets referred to in paragraphs 63–64 above 
shall be made in a manner that is country -driven, voluntary and in accordance with national 
circumstances, take into account sustainable development and poverty eradication, and do 
not constitute a basis for comparison between Parties; 
C. Means of implementation and support 
1. Finance 
66. Recalls Articles 2, 4 and 9, paragraphs 1–4, of the Paris Agreement; 
67. Highlights the growing gap between the needs of developing country Parties, in 
particular those due to the increasing impacts of climate change compounded by diff icult 
macroeconomic circumstances, and the support provided and mobilized for their efforts to 
implement their nationally determined contributions, highlighting that such needs are 
currently estimated at USD 5.8–5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period;3 
68. Also highlights that the adaptation finance needs of developing countries are estimated 
at USD 215 –387 billion annually up until 2030, and that about USD 4.3 trillion per year 
needs to be invested in clean energy up until 2030, increasing thereafter to USD 5 trillion per 
year up until 2050, to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2050;4

transforming energy scenario, by region, 2016–2050

rising global temperatures. Abu Dhabi: International Renewable Energy Agency. Available at 
www.irena.org/publications/2019/Sep/Transforming-the-energy-system. 
34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

 | FCCC/CP/2021/12/Add.1 
 39 (i) Thematic distribution 
22. Overall, needs related to adaptation are mentioned more often than those related to 
mitigation in all report types except BURs and LEDS, indicating greater attention to 
supporting developing countries’ expressed adaptation needs. For example, as shown in 
figure 2, NDCs included 1,991 needs for adaptation and 1,956 for mitigation. 
(ii) Regional distribution 
23. When the number of expressed needs across the nine national report types is 
considered, developing country Parties in the Africa and Asia -Pacific regions identified 
comparable numbers of needs across the national reports with broad thematic and sectoral 
coverage such as BURs, NCs and NDCs, comparable with the Latin America and Caribbean 
region only in the case of BURs (see figure 2, section 2.2). Developing country Parties in the 
Asia-Pacific region used NAPs and TAPs to further specify adaptation needs, as more than 
half of the needs identified in NAPs and TAPs were from this region. Developing country 
Parties in the Latin America and Caribbean, and Eastern European regions expressed more 
needs in their NCs than in other national reports . Latin American  and Caribbean Parties 
expressed a considerable number of adaptation needs in adaptation- specific national reports 
(e.g. ACs and NAPs) when compared with the overall number of needs expressed in their 
BURs and NDCs. Developing country Parties in the African region expressed more needs 
through TNAs compared with other regions, reporting 993 needs compared with the 642 
needs identified by Parties in the Asia-Pacific region. 
(iii) Distribution by means of implementation 
24. Qualitative data show a significant prevalence of capacity -building and technology 
development and transfer needs, which may in part be due to the resources developing 
countries can access to support the identification of these needs. The number of capacity -
building needs is higher than finance needs and technology development and transfer needs 
identified in the nine national report types except for TNAs (see figure 2, section 2.3). 
Capacity-building needs expressed across the national reports typically cover areas such as 
research, training and education, awareness -raising, institutional strengthening and 
coordination, and policy development. 
(iv) Sectoral and subsectoral distribution 
25. On the basis of the number of mitigation nee ds expressed across the nine national 
report types, energy is the lead sector for climate change mitigation actions, followed by land 
use and forestry, transport, agriculture, and waste and sanitation (see figure 3, section 3.1).  
26. When considering mitigation needs by sector and subsector, the nine types of national 
report show that most needs in the energy sector relate to requests for support for the energy 
efficiency and renewable energy subsectors, albeit with some variation betw een them. In 
NDCs, needs for renewable energy development were identified almost twice as frequently 
as those for energy efficiency (399 and 261, respectively) but the total nominal value of 
energy efficiency projects was 1.5 times larger than that of rene wable energy projects 
(USD 377.22 billion and USD 198.08 billion, respectively). In BURs and NCs, more needs 
related to renewable energy than to energy efficiency were identified. TNAs included a larger 
variation among energy subsectors, including the development of natural gas, the phasing-
out of inefficient subsidies, the exploration of carbon capture and storage, and the 
development of the efficient use of coal. 
27. The majority of expressed mitigation needs in the land- use and forestry sector  
represented a few densely forested countries, such as Bhutan, Brazil, the Congo, Costa Rica, 
Ghana, Guyana, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, 
Suriname, the United Republic of Tanzania and Viet Nam. This sector covers key activities 
such as reforestation, forest fire prevention, social forestry development, sustainable forest 
management, development of sustainable supply chains for forest commodities, spatial 
planning forestry research and some land-use activities, such as management of liv estock. 
Data in NCs and NDCs showed that, within this sector, needs related to reforestation are the 
largest needs expressed in financial terms. 
28. On the basis of the number of adaptation -related needs expressed across the nine 
national report types, agricul ture and water are the two lead sectors for climate change.","Here are the specific metrics that can be used to measure the success of each climate policy scenario:

**Government Incentives:**

1. **Tax Breaks and Subsidies Effectiveness**: Measure the number of companies investing in green hydrogen production facilities as a result of tax breaks and subsidies.
	* Justification: This KPI tracks the direct impact of government incentives on private sector investment in green hydrogen.

34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

adaptation actions, followed by disaster prevention and preparedness, coastal zone 
management and health (see figure 3, section 3.2).  
29. Adaptation needs in the agriculture sector cover a wide variet y of land uses that 
overlap with other key sectors. Needs related to agroforestry and irrigation, for example, also 
touch on areas or land managed under the forestry and water sectors. Needs related to the 
agriculture sector relate to crop diversification, development of resistant crops, land and soil 
management, livestock management, and fisheries and aquaculture. 
30. Adaptation needs in the water sector are dominated by the need for water distribution 
infrastructure, water harvesting and irrigation. Other types of need in this sector vary widely 
and cover water resource management, water storage and water sanitation. In NDCs, about 
38 per cent of expressed needs in the water sector include financial information. Water 
distribution infrastructure, including was tewater treatment, was the largest need in financial 
terms across all types of report. 
(c) Other areas of needs 
31. Developing country Parties also communicate other areas of needs that involve issues 
such as gender, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups. However, across the nine national 
report types, less than 10 per cent of needed activities referred to gender or specific 
communities. Where these topics are included in national reports, information tends to relate 
to commitments, policies and/or strategies. 
32. Some reports that expressed needs for policy development were linked to the SDGs 
and the Addis Ababa Action A genda. In general, the implementation of climate actions is 
mainstreamed in SDG-related actions. However, a few reports expressed needs focusing on 
institution-building and policy development, aiming to link climate commitments with the 
SDGs; for example, Jordan’s need to align its intended nationally determined contribution 
with the SDGs, and Morocco’s needs (expressed in its NCs) to strengthen the National 
Institutional Framework of Climate Change through a regulatory system based on the 
Framework Law on the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development.  
2. Information and data from reports by regional and global actors 
33. Information and data on the needs of developing countries are also available from 
regional and global reports. For the mitigat ion needs of developing countries, these reports 
use a mix of climate economic modelling for scenarios of below 2 °C, ranging from USD 2.4 
trillion to USD 4.7 trillion in annual energy -related investment needs globally; 8 investment 
opportunities based on stated national plans and targets including and beyond NDCs, ranging 
from USD 23.8–29.4 trillion for emerging markets from 2016 to 2030; 9 and investment 
estimates for achieving conditional NDC targets using carbon prices , for example USD 715 
billion in Africa10 (see figure 4 for an example of energy investment needs identified by the 
International Renewable Energy Agency11).

34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng

35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion

 12 As footnote 11 above.  | FCCC/CP/2021/12/Add.1 
 39 
(i) Thematic distribution 
22. Overall, needs related to adaptation are mentioned more often than those related to 
mitigation in all report types except BURs and LEDS, indicating greater attention to 
supporting developing countries’ expressed adaptation needs. For example, as shown in 
figure 2, NDCs included 1,991 needs for adaptation and 1,956 for mitigation. 
(ii) Regional distribution 
23. When the number of expressed needs across the nine national report types is 
considered, developing country Parties in the Africa and Asia -Pacific regions identified 
comparable numbers of needs across the national reports with broad thematic and sectoral 
coverage such as BURs, NCs and NDCs, comparable with the Latin America and Caribbean 
region only in the case of BURs (see figure 2, section 2.2). Developing country Parties in the 
Asia-Pacific region used NAPs and TAPs to further specify adaptation needs, as more than 
half of the needs identified in NAPs and TAPs were from this region. Developing country 
Parties in the Latin America and Caribbean, and Eastern European regions expressed more 
needs in their NCs than in other national reports . Latin American  and Caribbean Parties 
expressed a considerable number of adaptation needs in adaptation- specific national reports 
(e.g. ACs and NAPs) when compared with the overall number of needs expressed in their 
BURs and NDCs. Developing country Parties in the African region expressed more needs 
through TNAs compared with other regions, reporting 993 needs compared with the 642 
needs identified by Parties in the Asia-Pacific region. 
(iii) Distribution by means of implementation 
24. Qualitative data show a significant prevalence of capacity -building and technology 
development and transfer needs, which may in part be due to the resources developing 
countries can access to support the identification of these needs. The number of capacity -
building needs is higher than finance needs and technology development and transfer needs 
identified in the nine national report types except for TNAs (see figure 2, section 2.3). 
Capacity-building needs expressed across the national reports typically cover areas such as 
research, training and education, awareness -raising, institutional strengthening and 
coordination, and policy development. 
(iv) Sectoral and subsectoral distribution 
25. On the basis of the number of mitigation nee ds expressed across the nine national 
report types, energy is the lead sector for climate change mitigation actions, followed by land 
use and forestry, transport, agriculture, and waste and sanitation (see figure 3, section 3.1).  
26. When considering mitigation needs by sector and subsector, the nine types of national 
report show that most needs in the energy sector relate to requests for support for the energy 
efficiency and renewable energy subsectors, albeit with some variation betw een them. In 
NDCs, needs for renewable energy development were identified almost twice as frequently 
as those for energy efficiency (399 and 261, respectively) but the total nominal value of 
energy efficiency projects was 1.5 times larger than that of rene wable energy projects 
(USD 377.22 billion and USD 198.08 billion, respectively). In BURs and NCs, more needs 
related to renewable energy than to energy efficiency were identified. TNAs included a larger 
variation among energy subsectors, including the development of natural gas, the phasing-
out of inefficient subsidies, the exploration of carbon capture and storage, and the 
development of the efficient use of coal. 
27. The majority of expressed mitigation needs in the land- use and forestry sector  
represented a few densely forested countries, such as Bhutan, Brazil, the Congo, Costa Rica, 
Ghana, Guyana, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, 
Suriname, the United Republic of Tanzania and Viet Nam. This sector covers key activities 
such as reforestation, forest fire prevention, social forestry development, sustainable forest 
management, development of sustainable supply chains for forest commodities, spatial 
planning forestry research and some land-use activities, such as management of liv estock. 
Data in NCs and NDCs showed that, within this sector, needs related to reforestation are the 
largest needs expressed in financial terms. 
28. On the basis of the number of adaptation -related needs expressed across the nine 
national report types, agricul ture and water are the two lead sectors for climate change","Here are the specific metrics that can be used to measure the success of each scenario:

**Local Innovations:**

By 2025, Sub-Saharan Africa has become a hub for climate finance innovation, with several countries establishing their own green banks and sovereign wealth funds. The African Green Bond Alliance (AGBA) has been established to promote the issuance of green bonds in the region, with over $10 billion in outstanding bonds.

International organizations such as the World Bank and the European Union have increased their investments in climate finance, with a focus on supporting climate-resilient agriculture and water management projects. The African Renewable Energy Alliance (ARENA) has been established to promote the development of renewable energy sources in the region, with several countries achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

**Scenario 3: ""Risk-Reducing Partnership""**

By 2030, Sub-Saharan Africa has implemented a comprehensive risk mitigation strategy for climate finance, leveraging international partnerships and innovative financing mechanisms. The African Risk Mitigation Facility (ARMF) has been established to provide insurance products and risk management services to countries, reducing the risk of climate-related disasters.

International organizations such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the Climate Investment Funds (CIF) have increased their investments in climate finance, with a focus on supporting climate-resilient infrastructure projects. The African Union has established a dedicated Climate Change Fund, which provides financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation projects across the continent.","FCCC/CP/2022/10/Add.2

finance. International public climate finance flows to SIDS are predominantly adaptation 
focused. Grant finance plays a strong role in SIDS, ranging from 43 to 89 per cent across the 
channels analysed. The LDCs and SIDS have specific vulnerabilities and needs, which are 
partially reflected in the climate finance provided to them on a per capita basis. Per capita 
climate finance reached USD  3.6–16.9 for SIDS and USD  0.8–9.4 for the LDCs in 
2019–2020 (see figure 4).

25. Between 2016 and 2020, private climate finance mobilized by developed 
countries for developing countries through bilateral and multilateral channels totalled 
USD 66.8 billion.  Of this amount, 86 per cent was mobilized for mitigation actions, 
particularly in the energy sector (53 per cent of total mobilized finance in the five -year 
period). Private finance mo bilized for adaptation actions targeted industry, mining and 
construction. Private climate finance was mobilized through number of mechanisms, 
dominated by direct investment in companies and special purpose vehicles, which together 
accounted for 44 per cent of the total. MDBs mobilized 57 per cent of total estimated private 
climate finance, followed by bilateral providers and multilateral climate funds. SIDS and the 
LDCs received 1 and 8 per cent respectively of total private finance mobilized.

These metrics provide a structured framework for measuring progress and milestones in each scenario, allowing for evaluation of the effectiveness of different approaches to climate finance in Sub-Saharan Africa.","Based on the climate policy scenarios provided, I have identified the key drivers that will influence the success or failure of each scenario:

**Scenario 1: ""African Renaissance""**

Key Drivers:

1. **Economic conditions**: Strong economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, driven by increased investment and trade.
2. **Policy frameworks**: Robust policy environment supporting public-private partnerships (PPPs) and climate finance mobilization.
3. **Technology readiness**: Availability of innovative technologies for climate-resilient infrastructure projects.
4. **Public perception**: Widespread awareness and support for climate action among African governments, businesses, and citizens.
5. **Environmental constraints**: Urgent need to address climate-related challenges, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves.

Interactions:

* Economic growth drives investment in climate finance, which in turn supports economic development.
* Robust policy frameworks enable the establishment of a dedicated Climate Finance Facility, promoting public-private partnerships.
* Availability of innovative technologies facilitates the implementation of climate-resilient infrastructure projects.
* Public perception influences government commitment to climate action and private sector willingness to invest.

**Scenario 2: ""Climate Finance Catalyst""**

Key Drivers:

1. **Economic conditions**: Rapid economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, driven by increased investment and trade.
2. **Policy frameworks**: Pro-business policy environment supporting green banks and sovereign wealth funds.
3. **Technology readiness**: Availability of innovative technologies for renewable energy and climate-resilient agriculture projects.
4. **Public perception**: Strong public support for climate action among African governments, businesses, and citizens.
5. **Environmental constraints**: Urgent need to address climate-related challenges, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves.

Interactions:

* Rapid economic growth drives investment in green banks and sovereign wealth funds, which in turn supports climate finance mobilization.
* Pro-business policy environment enables the establishment of innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds.
* Availability of innovative technologies facilitates the implementation of renewable energy and climate-resilient agriculture projects.
* Public perception influences government commitment to climate action and private sector willingness to invest.

**Scenario 3: ""Risk-Reducing Partnership""**

Key Drivers:

1. **Economic conditions**: Stable economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa, driven by increased investment and trade.
2. **Policy frameworks**: Robust policy environment supporting risk mitigation strategies and insurance products.
3. **Technology readiness**: Availability of innovative technologies for climate-resilient infrastructure projects.
4. **Public perception**: Widespread awareness and support for climate action among African governments, businesses, and citizens.
5. **Environmental constraints**: Urgent need to address climate-related challenges, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves.

Interactions:

* Stable economic growth drives investment in risk mitigation strategies and insurance products, which in turn supports climate finance mobilization.
* Robust policy environment enables the establishment of a dedicated Climate Change Fund, promoting climate-resilient infrastructure projects.
* Availability of innovative technologies facilitates the implementation of climate-resilient infrastructure projects.
* Public perception influences government commitment to climate action and private sector willingness to invest.

In each scenario, key drivers interact with each other in complex ways. For example:

* Economic growth can drive investment in climate finance, which in turn supports economic development (Scenario 1).
* Pro-business policy environment can enable the establishment of innovative financing mechanisms, such as green bonds (Scenario 2).
* Availability of innovative technologies can facilitate the implementation of climate-resilient infrastructure projects, which in turn reduces environmental constraints (Scenarios 1 and 3).

Feedback loops and dependencies between key drivers can impact the scenario's success or failure. For instance:

* In Scenario 1, strong economic growth is dependent on robust policy frameworks supporting public-private partnerships.
* In Scenario 2, rapid economic growth drives investment in green banks and sovereign wealth funds, which in turn supports climate finance mobilization.
* In Scenario 3, stable economic growth is dependent on robust policy environment supporting risk mitigation strategies and insurance products.

Understanding these interactions and dependencies is crucial for designing effective climate policies that address the unique challenges facing Sub-Saharan Africa.","Here is a clear implementation roadmap with well-defined milestones for each of the climate policy scenarios:

34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

10. The continued decline in renewable energy technology costs in 2019–2020 compared 
with those in 2017 –2018 meant that renewable energy investments, despite the economic 
slowdown caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pand emic, remained close to the record 
high in 2017. Technology cost decreases in 2019–2020 compared with 2018 for onshore wind 
(13 per cent), offshore wind (9 per cent) and solar photovoltaic (7 per cent) emphasized how 
greater impacts are now achieved for ea ch new dollar invested. Aggregate investments in 
new renewable energy generation projects made up the largest segment of global climate 
finance. The declining costs of renewable energy alongside the maintenance of high levels 
of investment indicates that t he overall deployment of renewable energy technologies has 
increased in real terms.  
11. Government pandemic recovery packages included up to USD  513 billion of 
spending allocated to green or climate -related measures (21 per cent of the total 
USD 2.5 trillion) up until the end of 2020. Approximately 76 per cent (USD 392 billion) of 
climate-related recovery spending was announced by developed countries and the remainder 
by developing countries, particularly those in Asia. Data from climate budget tagging 
systems and other sources indicated domestic public climate finance amounted to USD  134 
billion per year in 2019 –2020, half of which was in 21 developing countries and the other 
half in 6 developed countries or jurisdictions.

* The global climate governance structure can create a framework for cooperation among regional bodies and national governments, reducing conflicts and increasing coordination.
* Participatory mechanisms can ensure that local communities' needs are taken into account, driving more effective decision-making.

**Scenario 5: ""Transformative Change""**

Key Drivers:

* Technological innovation driving demand for climate action
* Changing public opinion and increased global pressure pushing for transformative change
* Local communities driving demand for climate action

Interactions:

* The intersection of technological innovation and changing public opinion can create a tipping point, where the need for transformative change becomes more pressing.
* Local communities' demands for climate action can drive national governments and regional bodies to adopt more ambitious policies.

In general, the key drivers that will influence the success or failure of each scenario include:

1. Political will: The level of commitment from national governments, regional bodies, and local communities is crucial.
2. Stakeholder conflicts: Managing conflicts over resource allocation, distribution, and decision-making processes is essential for effective collaboration.
3. Resource allocation: Access to climate finance, technology, and capacity building can drive progress on climate action.
4. Institutional capacity: The development of robust institutional frameworks, including coordination mechanisms, communication channels, and conflict resolution processes, is critical.

These key drivers interact with each other in complex ways, creating dependencies or feedback loops that can impact the scenario. For example:

* A lack of political will can create an environment where stakeholder conflicts are more likely to arise.
* Empowered local communities can drive demand for climate action, pushing national governments and regional bodies to adopt more ambitious policies.

Understanding these interactions is essential for developing effective strategies to address climate change in each scenario.","Here is a clear implementation roadmap with well-defined milestones for each of the climate policy scenarios:

"Describe a range of worst-case ‘business as usual’ climate policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. Consider political inertia, minimal international support, and accelerating climate impacts, and explore the long-term social and economic consequences.","**Scenario 1: Low International Cooperation and Limited National Action**

* Global temperature increase: 3-4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100
* African countries fail to implement effective climate policies, leading to:
	+ Increased greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, industry, and transportation
	+ Worsening droughts, floods, and heatwaves, exacerbating food insecurity and water scarcity
	+ Loss of biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests and savannas
	+ Displacement of communities due to climate-related disasters and land degradation

**Scenario 2: Political Inertia and Lack of Climate Governance**

* African countries experience prolonged periods of political instability, corruption, and lack of effective governance
* Climate policies are often ignored or undermined by politicians seeking short-term gains
* As a result:
	+ Emissions continue to rise, leading to more frequent and severe climate-related disasters
	+ Climate change exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, particularly in rural areas
	+ The region's natural resources are exploited without regard for long-term sustainability

**Scenario 3: Accelerating Climate Impacts with Limited Adaptation**

* African countries fail to invest in climate resilience and adaptation measures, leading to:
	+ Increased frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves
	+ Loss of livelihoods and income for vulnerable communities, particularly small-scale farmers and herders
	+ Decreased access to basic services like healthcare, education, and sanitation due to climate-related disruptions

**Scenario 4: Climate-Related Conflicts and Migration**

* Climate change exacerbates existing social and economic tensions, leading to increased conflict over resources and territory
* African countries experience significant migration flows from climate-affected areas to urban centers or neighboring countries
* The region's stability is threatened by the influx of climate migrants, straining local resources and infrastructure

**Scenario 5: Economic Consequences of Climate Inaction**

* Sub-Saharan Africa experiences a decline in economic growth due to climate-related disasters, reduced agricultural productivity, and decreased investment in climate-resilient infrastructure
* The region's economy becomes increasingly dependent on imported goods, leading to trade deficits and reduced competitiveness
* The social and economic consequences of climate inaction lead to increased poverty, inequality, and social unrest

In all these scenarios, the long-term social and economic consequences are severe:

1. **Increased poverty and inequality**: Climate change exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, particularly in rural areas.
2. **Loss of livelihoods and income**: Climate-related disasters and changes in weather patterns lead to reduced agricultural productivity, decreased fishing opportunities, and reduced access to basic services like healthcare and education.
3. **Decreased human well-being**: Climate change leads to increased mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
4. **Reduced economic growth**: Climate-related disasters and changes in weather patterns lead to decreased investment in climate-resilient infrastructure, reduced agricultural productivity, and decreased competitiveness.
5. **Increased social unrest**: Climate change exacerbates existing social tensions, leading to increased conflict over resources and territory.","FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.2

**Scenario 3: Heatwaves and Human Health**

* **Short-term (0-2 years)**:
	+ Implement urban planning strategies that prioritize green spaces, cooling infrastructure, and heat-resistant buildings in one pilot city (e.g., Accra).
	+ Conduct a comprehensive assessment of heatwave risks and impacts across Sub-Saharan Africa.
	+ Develop a community-led heat stress management initiative pilot project in one affected country (e.g., Mozambique).
* **Medium-term (3-7 years)**:
	+ Invest $50 million in public health campaigns to raise awareness about heatwave risks and promote heat-stress prevention measures.
	+ Establish a regional heat stress management authority to coordinate response efforts.
	+ Develop and implement a comprehensive heatwave risk reduction plan for the region.
* **Long-term (8+ years)**:
	+ Invest $100 million in innovative technologies, such as smart cooling systems for buildings and homes, to address heatwaves.
	+ Develop and implement a regional heat health action plan that integrates public health campaigns, urban planning strategies, and climate-resilient infrastructure.

Critical decision points:

* Securing funding for public health campaigns and heat-stress prevention measures

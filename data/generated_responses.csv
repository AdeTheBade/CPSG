rising global temperatures. Abu Dhabi: International Renewable Energy Agency. Available at 
www.irena.org/publications/2019/Sep/Transforming-the-energy-system. 
34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

64. Affirms that the framework for the global go al on adaptation includes the following 
targets in relation to the dimensions of the iterative adaptation cycle, recognizing the need to 
enhance adaptation action and support: 
(a) Impact, vulnerability and risk assessment: by 2030 all Parties have conducted 
up-to-date assessments of climate hazards, climate change impacts and exposure to risks and 
vulnerabilities and have used the outcomes of these assessments to inform their formulation 
of national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and planning processes a nd/or strategies, 
and by 2027 all Parties have established multi -hazard early warning systems, climate 
information services for risk reduction and systematic observation to support improved 
climate-related data, information and services; 
(b) Planning: by 2030 all Parties have in place country-driven, gender-responsive, 
participatory and fully transparent national adaptation plans, policy instruments, and 
planning processes and/or strategies, covering, as appropriate, ecosystems, sectors, people 
and vulnerable communities, and have mainstreamed adaptation in all relevant strategies and 
plans; 
(c) Implementation: by 2030 all Parties have progressed in implementing their 
national adaptation plans, policies and strategies and, as a result, have reduced the social and 
economic impacts of the key climate hazards identified in the assessments referred to in 
paragraph 64(a) above; 
(d) Monitoring, evaluation and learning: by 2030 all Parties have designed, 
established and operationalized a system for monitoring, evaluation and learning for their 
national adaptation efforts and have built the required institutional capacity to fully 
implement the system; 
65. Also affirms that efforts in relation to the targets referred to in paragraphs 63–64 above 
shall be made in a manner that is country -driven, voluntary and in accordance with national 
circumstances, take into account sustainable development and poverty eradication, and do 
not constitute a basis for comparison between Parties; 
C. Means of implementation and support 
1. Finance 
66. Recalls Articles 2, 4 and 9, paragraphs 1–4, of the Paris Agreement; 
67. Highlights the growing gap between the needs of developing country Parties, in 
particular those due to the increasing impacts of climate change compounded by diff icult 
macroeconomic circumstances, and the support provided and mobilized for their efforts to 
implement their nationally determined contributions, highlighting that such needs are 
currently estimated at USD 5.8–5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period;3 
68. Also highlights that the adaptation finance needs of developing countries are estimated 
at USD 215 –387 billion annually up until 2030, and that about USD 4.3 trillion per year 
needs to be invested in clean energy up until 2030, increasing thereafter to USD 5 trillion per 
year up until 2050, to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2050;4

34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -

8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12 
 
 12 As footnote 11 above.  
 | FCCC/CP/2021/12/Add.1 
 39 (i) Thematic distribution 
22. Overall, needs related to adaptation are mentioned more often than those related to 
mitigation in all report types except BURs and LEDS, indicating greater attention to 
supporting developing countries’ expressed adaptation needs. For example, as shown in 
figure 2, NDCs included 1,991 needs for adaptation and 1,956 for mitigation. 
(ii) Regional distribution 
23. When the number of expressed needs across the nine national report types is 
considered, developing country Parties in the Africa and Asia -Pacific regions identified 
comparable numbers of needs across the national reports with broad thematic and sectoral 
coverage such as BURs, NCs and NDCs, comparable with the Latin America and Caribbean 
region only in the case of BURs (see figure 2, section 2.2). Developing country Parties in the 
Asia-Pacific region used NAPs and TAPs to further specify adaptation needs, as more than 
half of the needs identified in NAPs and TAPs were from this region. Developing country 
Parties in the Latin America and Caribbean, and Eastern European regions expressed more 
needs in their NCs than in other national reports . Latin American  and Caribbean Parties 
expressed a considerable number of adaptation needs in adaptation- specific national reports 
(e.g. ACs and NAPs) when compared with the overall number of needs expressed in their 
BURs and NDCs. Developing country Parties in the African region expressed more needs 
through TNAs compared with other regions, reporting 993 needs compared with the 642 
needs identified by Parties in the Asia-Pacific region. 
(iii) Distribution by means of implementation 
24. Qualitative data show a significant prevalence of capacity -building and technology 
development and transfer needs, which may in part be due to the resources developing 
countries can access to support the identification of these needs. The number of capacity -
building needs is higher than finance needs and technology development and transfer needs 
identified in the nine national report types except for TNAs (see figure 2, section 2.3). 
Capacity-building needs expressed across the national reports typically cover areas such as 
research, training and education, awareness -raising, institutional strengthening and 
coordination, and policy development. 
(iv) Sectoral and subsectoral distribution 
25. On the basis of the number of mitigation nee ds expressed across the nine national 
report types, energy is the lead sector for climate change mitigation actions, followed by land 
use and forestry, transport, agriculture, and waste and sanitation (see figure 3, section 3.1).  
26. When considering mitigation needs by sector and subsector, the nine types of national 
report show that most needs in the energy sector relate to requests for support for the energy 
efficiency and renewable energy subsectors, albeit with some variation betw een them. In 
NDCs, needs for renewable energy development were identified almost twice as frequently 
as those for energy efficiency (399 and 261, respectively) but the total nominal value of 
energy efficiency projects was 1.5 times larger than that of rene wable energy projects 
(USD 377.22 billion and USD 198.08 billion, respectively). In BURs and NCs, more needs 
related to renewable energy than to energy efficiency were identified. TNAs included a larger 
variation among energy subsectors, including the development of natural gas, the phasing-
out of inefficient subsidies, the exploration of carbon capture and storage, and the 
development of the efficient use of coal. 
27. The majority of expressed mitigation needs in the land- use and forestry sector  
represented a few densely forested countries, such as Bhutan, Brazil, the Congo, Costa Rica, 
Ghana, Guyana, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, 
Suriname, the United Republic of Tanzania and Viet Nam. This sector covers key activities 
such as reforestation, forest fire prevention, social forestry development, sustainable forest 
management, development of sustainable supply chains for forest commodities, spatial 
planning forestry research and some land-use activities, such as management of liv estock. 
Data in NCs and NDCs showed that, within this sector, needs related to reforestation are the 
largest needs expressed in financial terms. 
28. On the basis of the number of adaptation -related needs expressed across the nine 
national report types, agricul ture and water are the two lead sectors for climate change."

"Generate scenarios in which artificial intelligence (AI) and digital technologies are integrated into climate policy implementation across Sub-Saharan Africa. Consider applications in emissions monitoring, predictive modeling, and adaptive policymaking.","**Scenario 1: ""Climate Watch"" - AI-Powered Emissions Monitoring**

In this scenario, AI-powered sensors and drones are deployed in rural areas to monitor greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities. The data is collected and analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends. This information is then used to inform climate policies, such as subsidies for farmers who adopt low-carbon practices or incentives for the development of renewable energy sources.

The AI system, called ""Climate Watch,"" is integrated with existing national monitoring systems, allowing for real-time data sharing and coordination among governments, NGOs, and local communities. This scenario demonstrates how AI can enhance emissions monitoring, enabling more effective climate policy implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa.

**Scenario 2: ""Predictive Insights"" - AI-Driven Climate Modeling**

In this scenario, AI-powered predictive modeling is used to forecast climate-related risks and opportunities for Sub-Saharan African countries. The model takes into account factors such as population growth, urbanization, and economic development to predict the impacts of climate change on water resources, agriculture, and human health.

The predictive insights generated by the AI system are shared with policymakers, enabling them to make data-driven decisions about investments in climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation. For example, a country might use the model to identify areas most vulnerable to drought or flooding, allowing for targeted interventions and resource allocation.

**Scenario 3: ""Adaptive Governance"" - AI-Enhanced Policymaking**

In this scenario, AI is integrated into adaptive governance systems to support climate policy decision-making in Sub-Saharan Africa. The system uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from various sources, including satellite imagery, sensor data, and stakeholder feedback.

The AI system provides policymakers with real-time insights and recommendations on how to adapt policies to changing climate conditions. For example, if a country is experiencing drought, the system might suggest adjusting agricultural subsidies or investing in water conservation measures. This scenario demonstrates how AI can enhance adaptive governance, enabling more effective climate policy implementation in Sub-Saharan Africa.","FCCC/PA/CMA/2023/16/Add.1

adaptation actions, followed by disaster prevention and preparedness, coastal zone 
management and health (see figure 3, section 3.2).  
29. Adaptation needs in the agriculture sector cover a wide variet y of land uses that 
overlap with other key sectors. Needs related to agroforestry and irrigation, for example, also 
touch on areas or land managed under the forestry and water sectors. Needs related to the 
agriculture sector relate to crop diversification, development of resistant crops, land and soil 
management, livestock management, and fisheries and aquaculture. 
30. Adaptation needs in the water sector are dominated by the need for water distribution 
infrastructure, water harvesting and irrigation. Other types of need in this sector vary widely 
and cover water resource management, water storage and water sanitation. In NDCs, about 
38 per cent of expressed needs in the water sector include financial information. Water 
distribution infrastructure, including was tewater treatment, was the largest need in financial 
terms across all types of report. 
(c) Other areas of needs 
31. Developing country Parties also communicate other areas of needs that involve issues 
such as gender, indigenous peoples and vulnerable groups. However, across the nine national 
report types, less than 10 per cent of needed activities referred to gender or specific 
communities. Where these topics are included in national reports, information tends to relate 
to commitments, policies and/or strategies. 
32. Some reports that expressed needs for policy development were linked to the SDGs 
and the Addis Ababa Action A genda. In general, the implementation of climate actions is 
mainstreamed in SDG-related actions. However, a few reports expressed needs focusing on 
institution-building and policy development, aiming to link climate commitments with the 
SDGs; for example, Jordan’s need to align its intended nationally determined contribution 
with the SDGs, and Morocco’s needs (expressed in its NCs) to strengthen the National 
Institutional Framework of Climate Change through a regulatory system based on the 
Framework Law on the National Charter for Environment and Sustainable Development.  
2. Information and data from reports by regional and global actors 
33. Information and data on the needs of developing countries are also available from 
regional and global reports. For the mitigat ion needs of developing countries, these reports 
use a mix of climate economic modelling for scenarios of below 2 °C, ranging from USD 2.4 
trillion to USD 4.7 trillion in annual energy -related investment needs globally; 8 investment 
opportunities based on stated national plans and targets including and beyond NDCs, ranging 
from USD 23.8–29.4 trillion for emerging markets from 2016 to 2030; 9 and investment 
estimates for achieving conditional NDC targets using carbon prices , for example USD 715 
billion in Africa10 (see figure 4 for an example of energy investment needs identified by the 
International Renewable Energy Agency11).

(i) Thematic distribution 
22. Overall, needs related to adaptation are mentioned more often than those related to 
mitigation in all report types except BURs and LEDS, indicating greater attention to 
supporting developing countries’ expressed adaptation needs. For example, as shown in 
figure 2, NDCs included 1,991 needs for adaptation and 1,956 for mitigation. 
(ii) Regional distribution 
23. When the number of expressed needs across the nine national report types is 
considered, developing country Parties in the Africa and Asia -Pacific regions identified 
comparable numbers of needs across the national reports with broad thematic and sectoral 
coverage such as BURs, NCs and NDCs, comparable with the Latin America and Caribbean 
region only in the case of BURs (see figure 2, section 2.2). Developing country Parties in the 
Asia-Pacific region used NAPs and TAPs to further specify adaptation needs, as more than 
half of the needs identified in NAPs and TAPs were from this region. Developing country 
Parties in the Latin America and Caribbean, and Eastern European regions expressed more 
needs in their NCs than in other national reports . Latin American  and Caribbean Parties 
expressed a considerable number of adaptation needs in adaptation- specific national reports 
(e.g. ACs and NAPs) when compared with the overall number of needs expressed in their 
BURs and NDCs. Developing country Parties in the African region expressed more needs 
through TNAs compared with other regions, reporting 993 needs compared with the 642 
needs identified by Parties in the Asia-Pacific region. 
(iii) Distribution by means of implementation 
24. Qualitative data show a significant prevalence of capacity -building and technology 
development and transfer needs, which may in part be due to the resources developing 
countries can access to support the identification of these needs. The number of capacity -
building needs is higher than finance needs and technology development and transfer needs 
identified in the nine national report types except for TNAs (see figure 2, section 2.3). 
Capacity-building needs expressed across the national reports typically cover areas such as 
research, training and education, awareness -raising, institutional strengthening and 
coordination, and policy development. 
(iv) Sectoral and subsectoral distribution 
25. On the basis of the number of mitigation nee ds expressed across the nine national 
report types, energy is the lead sector for climate change mitigation actions, followed by land 
use and forestry, transport, agriculture, and waste and sanitation (see figure 3, section 3.1).  
26. When considering mitigation needs by sector and subsector, the nine types of national 
report show that most needs in the energy sector relate to requests for support for the energy 
efficiency and renewable energy subsectors, albeit with some variation betw een them. In 
NDCs, needs for renewable energy development were identified almost twice as frequently 
as those for energy efficiency (399 and 261, respectively) but the total nominal value of 
energy efficiency projects was 1.5 times larger than that of rene wable energy projects 
(USD 377.22 billion and USD 198.08 billion, respectively). In BURs and NCs, more needs 
related to renewable energy than to energy efficiency were identified. TNAs included a larger 
variation among energy subsectors, including the development of natural gas, the phasing-
out of inefficient subsidies, the exploration of carbon capture and storage, and the 
development of the efficient use of coal. 
27. The majority of expressed mitigation needs in the land- use and forestry sector  
represented a few densely forested countries, such as Bhutan, Brazil, the Congo, Costa Rica, 
Ghana, Guyana, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, 
Suriname, the United Republic of Tanzania and Viet Nam. This sector covers key activities 
such as reforestation, forest fire prevention, social forestry development, sustainable forest 
management, development of sustainable supply chains for forest commodities, spatial 
planning forestry research and some land-use activities, such as management of liv estock. 
Data in NCs and NDCs showed that, within this sector, needs related to reforestation are the 
largest needs expressed in financial terms. 
28. On the basis of the number of adaptation -related needs expressed across the nine 
national report types, agricul ture and water are the two lead sectors for climate change"
"Develop potential future climate policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa that emphasize sustainable land use and afforestation. Consider incentives for reforestation, carbon sequestration policies, and indigenous land management practices.","**Scenario 1: ""Green Belt"" Scenario**

In this scenario, governments in Sub-Saharan Africa commit to establishing a network of protected areas, including national parks, wildlife reserves, and community-managed forests. These protected areas would be managed sustainably, with a focus on reforestation, agroforestry, and eco-tourism.

* Incentives for reforestation: Governments provide financial incentives, such as subsidies and tax breaks, to landowners who plant trees or engage in sustainable forest management.
* Carbon sequestration policies: A carbon pricing mechanism is established to incentivize landowners to adopt sustainable land use practices that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
* Indigenous land management practices: Traditional indigenous communities are recognized and supported in their efforts to manage their lands sustainably, using practices such as agroforestry and permaculture.

**Scenario 2: ""Agricultural Renaissance"" Scenario**

In this scenario, governments prioritize sustainable agriculture practices that promote soil health, biodiversity, and efficient water use. This includes initiatives such as:

* Agroforestry: Integrating trees into agricultural landscapes to promote ecological interactions and reduce deforestation.
* Conservation Agriculture: Minimizing soil disturbance, conserving soil moisture, and promoting crop rotations to reduce synthetic fertilizer use.
* Climate-Smart Agriculture: Promoting agricultural practices that sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, such as cover cropping and organic amendments.

**Scenario 3: ""Eco-Industrialization"" Scenario**

In this scenario, governments prioritize eco-industrial development, focusing on industries that promote sustainable land use and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This includes initiatives such as:

34. Reports based on energy–economy models note that developing country regions have 
the largest investment gaps compared with historical trends to achieving climate scenarios in 
line with the Paris Agreement. Three to fourfold increases of investment are necessary in 
both renewable energy and energy efficiency across many regions that include developi ng 
countries. 
35. Regional and global reports also provide estimates related to adaptation and resilience. 
Costs based on bottom-up national and sector-based studies (ranging from USD  140 billion 
to USD 300 billion annually by 2030) measuring impacts to GDP (for example, ranging from 
USD 289.2 billion to USD 440.5 billion up to 2030 in Africa) and the incremental investment 
needed to upgrade or retrofit infrastructure stock (ranging from USD  11 billion to USD 670 
billion in annual incremental costs) are most prevalent. 
36. To make current and future infrastructure climate- resilient, annual costs as a 
percentage of GDP are at least double in countries with emerging market economies, low -
income countries and small States compared with the costs in high -income countries, that is 
1.1–1.49 per cent compared with 0.45 per cent. Investment needs expressed as a percentage 
of GDP for upgrading new infrastructure and coastal protection are proportionally greater in 
lower-income countries and small States, w hile retrofitting existing infrastructure is the 
major cost component in countries with emerging market economies. However, the reports 
also noted that specific knowledge on the degree of exposure of infrastructure to natural 
hazards, related to their location, intensity and level of risk, could affect the incremental cost 
of making infrastructure climate -resilient (e.g. 3 per cent of total investment as opposed to 
8–45 per cent) (see figure 5).12

10. The continued decline in renewable energy technology costs in 2019–2020 compared 
with those in 2017 –2018 meant that renewable energy investments, despite the economic 
slowdown caused by the coronavirus disease 2019 pand emic, remained close to the record 
high in 2017. Technology cost decreases in 2019–2020 compared with 2018 for onshore wind 
(13 per cent), offshore wind (9 per cent) and solar photovoltaic (7 per cent) emphasized how 
greater impacts are now achieved for ea ch new dollar invested. Aggregate investments in 
new renewable energy generation projects made up the largest segment of global climate 
finance. The declining costs of renewable energy alongside the maintenance of high levels 
of investment indicates that t he overall deployment of renewable energy technologies has 
increased in real terms.  
11. Government pandemic recovery packages included up to USD  513 billion of 
spending allocated to green or climate -related measures (21 per cent of the total 
USD 2.5 trillion) up until the end of 2020. Approximately 76 per cent (USD 392 billion) of 
climate-related recovery spending was announced by developed countries and the remainder 
by developing countries, particularly those in Asia. Data from climate budget tagging 
systems and other sources indicated domestic public climate finance amounted to USD  134 
billion per year in 2019 –2020, half of which was in 21 developing countries and the other 
half in 6 developed countries or jurisdictions.

"What are potential future climate policy pathways in Sub-Saharan Africa if carbon markets and offset schemes become mainstream? Outline how governments, regional bodies, and local communities might participate or benefit.","**Pathway 1: Carbon Pricing and Emissions Reduction**

* Governments, regional bodies, and local communities might establish a carbon pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade system, to incentivize emissions reductions.
* Carbon markets could be developed to allow countries to buy and sell carbon credits, providing a financial incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
* Local communities might benefit from revenue generated from carbon pricing, which could be used to fund climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.

**Pathway 2: Offsetting and Sustainable Development**

* Governments, regional bodies, and local communities might prioritize offsetting emissions from industrial activities, such as mining or agriculture, by investing in renewable energy projects or reforestation programs.
* Carbon offset schemes could be developed to allow companies to purchase credits for reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, providing a financial incentive for sustainable development practices.
* Local communities might benefit from the creation of new jobs and economic opportunities generated by offsetting activities.

**Pathway 3: Climate-Resilient Infrastructure Development**

* Governments, regional bodies, and local communities might prioritize climate-resilient infrastructure development, such as sea walls, flood-resistant buildings, or green roofs.
* Carbon markets could be used to finance the development of climate-resilient infrastructure, providing a financial incentive for countries to invest in adaptation measures.
* Local communities might benefit from improved access to basic services, such as healthcare and education, which are often compromised by climate-related disasters.

**Pathway 4: Climate-Smart Agriculture**

* Governments, regional bodies, and local communities might prioritize climate-smart agriculture practices, such as agroforestry or conservation agriculture.
* Carbon markets could be used to finance the development of climate-resilient agricultural systems, providing a financial incentive for farmers to adopt sustainable practices.
* Local communities might benefit from improved food security, increased income opportunities, and reduced poverty.

**Participation and Benefits**

Governments, regional bodies, and local communities can participate in carbon markets and offset schemes in various ways:

1. **National governments**: Establish carbon pricing mechanisms, develop national carbon markets, and invest in climate change mitigation and adaptation projects.
2. **Regional bodies**: Develop regional carbon markets, establish standards for carbon credits, and facilitate cooperation among countries to achieve shared climate goals.
3. **Local communities**: Benefit from revenue generated from carbon pricing, participate in offsetting activities, and benefit from improved access to basic services and economic opportunities.

To ensure that local communities benefit from mainstreaming carbon markets and offset schemes, governments and regional bodies should:

1. **Involve local communities** in the development of climate change policies and projects.
2. **Ensure transparency and accountability** in the operation of carbon markets and offset schemes.
3. **Provide support for capacity building** among local communities to participate in carbon markets and offset schemes.

purpose and goals of the Paris Agreement, while at the same time recognizing the importance 
of rapidly accelerating the transformational changes towa rds climate resilience and low 
greenhouse gas emission development.  
10. Actions and activities under this key theme should therefore facilitate the 
implementation of collaborative technology development and transfer, build on the past and 
ongoing work of the Technology Mechanism and take into account the role of North–South, 
South–South, triangular and regional collaboration in facilitating implementation.  
11. Actions and activities under this key theme should also facilitate the implementation 
of mitigation and adaptation action identified using planning tools and processes such as 
nationally determined contributions, long -term low greenhouse gas emission development 
strategies, technology needs assessments (TNAs), national adaptation plans, technology road 
maps and other relevant policies, and facilitate overcoming challenges by implementing such 
action, as appropriate. 
12. Actions and activities in this area of work include: 
(a) Facilitating the undertaking and updating of TNAs, as well as enhancing the 
implementation of their results, particularly technology action plans and project ideas, and 
capacity-building related to TNAs; 
(b) Promoting the link or alignment of TNAs with nationally determined

"Generate a set of climate policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa that show how collaboration between local, national, and regional bodies might evolve. Include considerations of political will, stakeholder conflicts, and resource allocation.","**Scenario 1: ""Stalled Progress""**

* In this scenario, political will to address climate change is lacking at all levels (local, national, and regional).
* Stakeholder conflicts over resource allocation and distribution hinder cooperation.
* National governments prioritize short-term economic gains over long-term climate mitigation efforts.
* Regional bodies struggle to coordinate efforts due to lack of trust and communication among member states.
* Local communities are left to fend for themselves, with limited access to climate finance and technology.

**Scenario 2: ""Incremental Progress""**

* In this scenario, local governments begin to take the lead on climate action, driven by community-based initiatives and grassroots mobilization.
* National governments gradually increase their commitment to climate change mitigation, but only after significant pressure from civil society and international partners.
* Regional bodies start to play a more active role in coordinating regional efforts, but face challenges in harmonizing policies across member states.
* Climate finance flows into the region, primarily through international channels, with limited impact on local communities.

**Scenario 3: ""Regional Leadership""**

* In this scenario, regional bodies (e.g., ECOWAS, SADC) take a proactive role in driving climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts across the sub-region.
* National governments recognize the importance of regional cooperation and begin to align their policies with regional goals.
* Local communities are empowered to participate in decision-making processes and benefit from climate finance and technology.
* Regional bodies establish a robust framework for coordination, communication, and conflict resolution.

**Scenario 4: ""Global-Regional-National Collaboration""**

* In this scenario, global climate governance structures (e.g., Paris Agreement) facilitate collaboration between regional bodies and national governments on climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts.
* Local communities are integrated into the decision-making process through participatory mechanisms and benefit from increased access to climate finance and technology.
* Regional bodies play a key role in facilitating knowledge sharing, capacity building, and policy harmonization across member states.
* National governments prioritize climate action, recognizing its economic and social benefits.

**Scenario 5: ""Transformative Change""**

* In this scenario, a combination of factors (e.g., technological innovation, changing public opinion, increased global pressure) leads to a transformative shift in the region's approach to climate change.
* Local communities drive demand for climate action, pushing national governments and regional bodies to adopt more ambitious policies.
* Regional bodies establish a comprehensive framework for climate governance, integrating economic, social, and environmental considerations.
* Climate finance flows into the region, primarily through domestic sources, with significant impact on local communities.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Political Will**: The level of commitment from national governments, regional bodies, and local communities to address climate change will significantly influence the evolution of collaboration.
2. **Stakeholder Conflicts**: Managing conflicts over resource allocation, distribution, and decision-making processes is crucial for effective collaboration.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Access to climate finance, technology, and capacity building will be critical in driving progress on climate action.

**Scenario 2: ""Climate-Resilient Water Management""**

* **Objective:** To prioritize climate-resilient water management practices in shared water basins, with a focus on reducing competition and conflict over this vital resource.
* **Policy Measures:**
	+ Implement water-saving technologies and practices that reduce the demand for shared water resources.
	+ Promote water conservation and efficient use of water in agriculture, industry, and urban areas.
	+ Support the development of climate-resilient irrigation systems and agricultural practices that minimize water waste and optimize water use.
* **Incentives:**
	+ Offer subsidies or tax breaks to farmers and businesses that adopt climate-resilient water management practices.
	+ Provide technical assistance and training programs for water managers, farmers, and other stakeholders on climate-resilient water management.

**Scenario 3: ""Conflict Prevention through Climate Diplomacy""**

* **Objective:** To use climate change as a tool for conflict prevention and diplomacy in Sub-Saharan Africa, by addressing the root causes of competition and conflict over transboundary resources.
* **Policy Measures:**
	+ Establish a regional climate diplomacy framework that brings together countries to address shared challenges and opportunities related to climate change.
	+ Support the development of climate-resilient infrastructure and water management practices that reduce competition and conflict over shared resources.
	+ Encourage dialogue and cooperation between countries on issues related to transboundary resource management, with a focus on finding mutually beneficial solutions.
* **Incentives:**
	+ Offer diplomatic incentives for countries that demonstrate leadership in regional climate diplomacy efforts.
	+ Provide technical assistance and capacity-building support to help countries develop their own climate diplomacy frameworks.

**Exploring the Impact of Climate Stressors**

Climate stressors, such as droughts, floods, and changes in temperature and precipitation patterns, can exacerbate conflict or incentivize deeper regional cooperation over transboundary resources. For example:

* **Drought:** Droughts can lead to increased competition for water resources, particularly in pastoral lands where livestock are a critical source of livelihood. Climate-resilient irrigation systems and agricultural practices can help reduce the demand for shared water resources.
* **Floods:** Floods can damage infrastructure and disrupt economic activity, leading to increased tensions between countries over transboundary resource management. Climate-resilient water management practices and early warning systems can help mitigate these impacts.

Incentivizing deeper regional cooperation through climate diplomacy can also help address the root causes of competition and conflict over transboundary resources. By addressing shared challenges and opportunities related to climate change, countries can build trust and foster greater cooperation on issues related to transboundary resource management.","FCCC/CP/2001/13/Add.1

"Describe a range of worst-case ‘business as usual’ climate policy scenarios for Sub-Saharan Africa. Consider political inertia, minimal international support, and accelerating climate impacts, and explore the long-term social and economic consequences.","**Scenario 1: Low International Cooperation and Limited National Action**

* Global temperature increase: 3-4°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100
* African countries fail to implement effective climate policies, leading to:
	+ Increased greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, industry, and transportation
	+ Worsening droughts, floods, and heatwaves, exacerbating food insecurity and water scarcity
	+ Loss of biodiversity, particularly in tropical forests and savannas
	+ Displacement of communities due to climate-related disasters and land degradation

**Scenario 2: Political Inertia and Lack of Climate Governance**

* African countries experience prolonged periods of political instability, corruption, and lack of effective governance
* Climate policies are often ignored or undermined by politicians seeking short-term gains
* As a result:
	+ Emissions continue to rise, leading to more frequent and severe climate-related disasters
	+ Climate change exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, particularly in rural areas
	+ The region's natural resources are exploited without regard for long-term sustainability

**Scenario 3: Accelerating Climate Impacts with Limited Adaptation**

* African countries fail to invest in climate resilience and adaptation measures, leading to:
	+ Increased frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, such as droughts, floods, and heatwaves
	+ Loss of livelihoods and income for vulnerable communities, particularly small-scale farmers and herders
	+ Decreased access to basic services like healthcare, education, and sanitation due to climate-related disruptions

**Scenario 4: Climate-Related Conflicts and Migration**

* Climate change exacerbates existing social and economic tensions, leading to increased conflict over resources and territory
* African countries experience significant migration flows from climate-affected areas to urban centers or neighboring countries
* The region's stability is threatened by the influx of climate migrants, straining local resources and infrastructure

**Scenario 5: Economic Consequences of Climate Inaction**

* Sub-Saharan Africa experiences a decline in economic growth due to climate-related disasters, reduced agricultural productivity, and decreased investment in climate-resilient infrastructure
* The region's economy becomes increasingly dependent on imported goods, leading to trade deficits and reduced competitiveness
* The social and economic consequences of climate inaction lead to increased poverty, inequality, and social unrest

In all these scenarios, the long-term social and economic consequences are severe:

1. **Increased poverty and inequality**: Climate change exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities, particularly in rural areas.
2. **Loss of livelihoods and income**: Climate-related disasters and changes in weather patterns lead to reduced agricultural productivity, decreased fishing opportunities, and reduced access to basic services like healthcare and education.
3. **Decreased human well-being**: Climate change leads to increased mortality rates, particularly among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
4. **Reduced economic growth**: Climate-related disasters and changes in weather patterns lead to decreased investment in climate-resilient infrastructure, reduced agricultural productivity, and decreased competitiveness.
5. **Increased social unrest**: Climate change exacerbates existing social tensions, leading to increased conflict over resources and territory.","FCCC/CP/2000/5/Add.2
